sortOfRemoteNG

A sort of remoteNG inspired web app that runs on the browser. Very broken and non functional though, it's an experiment.

## Testing


To run the unit tests, first install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then execute:

```bash
npm test
```

Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed on your system before running the commands.

## Appearance

The interface supports selectable color schemes (blue, green, purple, red, orange and teal). Use the settings dialog to choose your preferred scheme.
