//! Shared TOFU TLS plumbing for the WinRM/PowerShell management client.
//!
//! Historically the WinRM transport (`transport.rs`) and the connection
//! diagnostics (`diagnostics.rs`) called
//! `reqwest::ClientBuilder::danger_accept_invalid_certs(true)` whenever the
//! connection's `skip_ca_check` / `skip_cn_check` flags were set — sending
//! credentials to a server whose certificate was never checked or memorized.
//!
//! This module folds all of those skip sites onto the shared
//! [`sorng_tls_trust`] plumbing so the certificate decision routes through the
//! backend **Trust Center** with **Trust-On-First-Use (TOFU)** as the default
//! policy. The legacy skip flags become an explicit, visible, revocable
//! `AlwaysTrust` per-connection override (via [`skip_flag_to_override`]) rather
//! than a blind skip.
//!
//! The verifier still performs full signature/chain cryptography — TOFU pins
//! *identity* only (see `sorng-tls-trust`).
